# Docker Application plugin for Visual Studio

This directory contains the sources of a Docker Application plugin for Visual Studio.

The plugin creates a few commands in the `Tools` menu.

# Restoring dependencies

Run .\nuget.exe restore

# Building the plugin

Open the `dockerappvsix.sln` solution in Visual Studio, change the target to `Release` and hit build. This will produce the plugin under `dockerappvsix/bin/Release/dockerappvsix.vsix`.

# Installing the plugin

Simply double-click on the `dockerappsvix.vsix` file in the explorer. This will prompt you to install the extension.

# Using the plugin

The plugin exposes the following commands in the `Tools` menu:

## New application

This command displays a dialog that can be used to initialize a new Docker Application.

It gives you the option to chose the name, description and maintainers of the application, as well as whether to use single-file mode or not.


## Select application

By default all operations will look for a single Docker Application at the root of the solution directory. If your application is located elswhere, or if you have multiple applications, you can use the `select application` menu to select which application will be used.

## Render

`Render` simply renders the application in a popup window.

## Settings

`Settings` pops-up a dialog that can be used to configure deployment parameters, such as which orchestrator to use, the stack name and namespace, and settings overrides.

## Deploy

`Deploy` deploys your application to a cluster. Progress or eventual errors are displayed in the event log.
